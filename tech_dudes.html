        <h2>A glance through on what covid-19 was!!</h2>
        <img src="https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/Health-worker-PPE_checking-patient-14042021-PTI-1200.jpg" alt="Treating covid-19 patient">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2019–2020 coronavirus pandemic was upending life on a global level as we know it. The highly infectious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first seen in Wuhan, Hubei, China where its outbreak was first identified in December 2019. After almost 3 months, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization recognized it as a pandemic considering its significant ongoing spread in multiple countries across the world.    As of April 11, 2020, approximately 1,741,621 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in over 210 countries and territories resulting in around 106,670 deaths. Clearly, the corona virus outbreak situation cannot be taken lightly. Global pandemic of COVID 19, its ophthalmic implications, and precautions are nicely summarized in recently published editorial.
    <!--------------------------An image showing the fight against covid-19----------------->
        While on one hand people across India and around the globe are largely confined to their homes with businesses and educational institutions all shut down in an attempt to contain the virus, and on the other hand doctors, health-care workers, and medical staff members are leading the battle against COVID-19 from the front. Putting their own lives at risk with selfless determination for the sake of saving lives, they truly are our heroes in these challenging times. While they are putting their own health, families, and most importantly their own lives at risk, the least we can do is appreciate their efforts and cooperate by staying safe indoors. That being said, it is good to see tributes pouring in for all the medical heroes working in scrubs.

    </p>
    <h2>Doctors, Health-care Workers and Fight against COVID-19:</h2>
    <p>
        <img src="https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2021/06/1622640829_covid19.jpg" alt="covid rapid test">Needless to say, doctors, nurses and people working in health-care sectors are particularly vulnerable to the highly infectious disease. In response to the global pandemic, the under-resourced doctors are facing unprecedented challenges. The list of the sleep-deprived heroes includes doctors, nurses, medical cleaners, pathologists, paramedics, ambulance drivers, and health-care administrators. In the fight against coronavirus, the brave medical army stands strong with thermometers, stethoscopes, and ventilators as their weapons. Not to forget, medical researchers are working day in and night out against all odds, hoping to find the antidote to the disease.
        Since the coronavirus outbreak, health-care professionals have not only experienced the gratification of healing patients and saving their lives but have also lost many battles along the way. On top of that, many doctors have even sacrificed their own lives in the line of duty.
        Every day, the selfless warriors are giving it their all in health-care settings while cutting themselves off from their families and loved ones. The sacrifice that they are making for the safety and welfare of humanity is priceless and deserves lifelong gratitude on our end. Most importantly, we must reassess the value health-care workers hold in our lives and the kind of treatment they get from us. Among the several lessons this coronavirus pandemic has been teaching us, the biggest one is to find ways to sufficiently invest in the better and more efficient medical fraternity and give medical professionals the respect, compensation and infrastructure that they truly deserve once this crisis is over. Moreover, the world needs to work towards advancement in medical research and technology. Nothing will be a greater tribute to the health-care workers than this.
        That being said, we'd now like to highlight the heroic efforts of some courageous and inspiring doctors from across the globe who lost their lives while saving the lives of COVID-19 patients.

<h2>Impact of second wave of COVID-19 on health care workers in India:<br></h2>
<p>
    <img src="https://secure3.vncdn.vn/ttnew/r/2021/05/09/india-1620547687.jpg" alt="covid rapid test">
    The unprecedented second wave of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic has caught an already weak public health system unaware in India. The rising number of COVID-19 afflicted patients, shortage of testing strategy, disorganized vaccination drive, lack of oxygen-supported beds, and overwhelmed medical facilities in cities across India has led to a quintessential crisis never experienced before. Physicians, doctors, and other healthcare workers (HCWs) still recovering from the socioeconomic and adverse impact of the first wave, now face a further whirlpool of unfavorable mitigating factors including shortage of personnel, stretched resources, inadequate medical equipment, facilities, and the ever-existent occupational risk of contracting of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and mortality. Exhibiting exemplary dedication, public health effort, and resilience in the health care management of COVID-19 patients in the first wave, they face an uphill task against the second deadlier wave. We explore the mounting challenges confronting these HCW and strategic solutions that can be undertaken to support them.<br>
    <h2><br><br>798 doctors died during second wave of Covid-19 across country</h2>

    <p>Ever since the second wave of infections hit, Karnataka has lost three doctors — Dr GN Ganesh Kumar, 59, from Chamarajan Dr Mahesh, a paediatrician from 
        Ramanagar district and Dr Ramegowda CC, 51, from Bengaluru — to Covid-19. All three had taken at least the first dose of the vaccine, their colleagues told TOI. While Dr Ramegowda, 
        founder and head of Rashi Diagnostic Centre, died on Thursday, Dr Ganesh, who worked as a medical officer in a general hospital in Kollegal taluk, breathed his last on Tuesday (April 27). Dr Mahesh,
